This is minimalist proof-of-concept implementation of Babel (RFC6126).

It is written in Python 3.4(+), uses normal Python socket API, and
Linux "ip" command to interact with the rest of the system.

If you ever think to use this for production use, don't!

Intentional limitations:
- IPv6 only (legacy IP? what's that?)

'recently heard from' = ?

'timer' <> 'time value' distinction is somewhat lacking in my opinion; some
things require action at time point, and others do need just to be kept
track of (e.g. 'hello timer''s various incarnations)

route table defined in 3.2.5 does not contain router id entries, yet 3.5.4
refers to one

3.5.4 what is 'id' in the updates and where is it stored? and what does the
link cost = cost mean?

3.5.5 describes what is done in 3.5.4, but to little point (imho)

3.6 'unfeasible route' = ?.. I assumed route table only contains feasible
routes to start with?

3.7.3: 'modified entry'; what if it was not modified? no gc reset? I
assume so..

3.8.1.2 .. in response to a _seqno_ request, not route request
cannot parse 'no smaller'; not smaller?

3.8.2.1 is there necessarily seqno in the source table for all nodes? much
easier just to use seqno from the route that is being retracted.. (maybe
there is, but shrug)

SHOULD AE 1 or 3 for NH; why not 2? (ok, LL is better I guess..)

'recently heard from' = ?

'timer' <> 'time value' distinction is somewhat lacking in my opinion; some
things require action at time point, and others do need just to be kept
track of (e.g. 'hello timer''s various incarnations)

route table defined in 3.2.5 does not contain router id entries, yet 3.5.4
refers to one

3.5.5 describes what is done in 3.5.4, but to little point (imho)

3.6 'unfeasible route' = ?.. I assumed route table only contains feasible
routes to start with?

3.7.3: 'modified entry'; what if it was not modified? no gc reset? I
assume so..
